Semester management process

1. Get into R classes, or (isregclass = true) classes. These should have R in the name, i.e. 3R or MR. We call these registration classes, and all registrations are staged here initially. This applies to before school starts. If a student registers, they are staged here. This is also called the pre-disperse phase. Once you disperse the registered students into classrooms, i.e. to 3A, 3B, 3C, etc. Now, we are in a post-disperse phase. However, anyone who registers after this disperse WILL STILL BE STAGED IN the registration class, in this case 3R. You can either manually assign them to one of 3A, 3B, or 3C, or you can just press disperse again. Disperse only affects the registrations still attached to the R classes. Think of it as a staging area. TODO: Allow this dispersion to be done automatically in the post disperse phase. 
2. We cannot do dispersion automatically since size and logistical limits are unknown during registration. You must manually assign classrooms and teachers, and preferably size limits to reflect reality, or else dispersion will simply disperse as evenly as possible. TODO: Make classroom and teacher selection very easy by using last years values.
